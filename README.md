# Instant ComfyUI for MacOS

This script will install ComfyUI and all dependencies on macOS.  I made this for my own use, but you're welcome to use it.

## Usage

Copy and paste this single line into your terminal:

```bash
/bin/zsh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matt-harvey/instant-comfyui/main/instant-comfyui.sh)"
```

This will:
- Install Homebrew (if not already installed)
- Install required dependencies
- Set up ComfyUI with a virtual environment
- Create a desktop launcher
- Launch ComfyUI automatically
